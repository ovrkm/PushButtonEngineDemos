 //	OVERVIEW	  
 //		This is a simple, complete videogame programmed to show common gaming concepts.
 //
 
 //	PROJECT SETUP DETAILS
 //		TYPE		: Flash and ActionScript 3.0
 //		IDE			: Flash Builder 4.6
 //		TARGET		: Publish 'FlyerGame.as' as the main application file to create a swf and run it with a Flash Enabled browser.
 //		DEPENDENCIES	: Requires the PushButtonEngine VERSION 2 (http://PushButtonEngine.com/) framework. This *IS* included for you.
 //		COMPILER ARGS   :	

 //	DOCUMENTATION
 //		See this document './read_me.txt' for any instructions.

 //	INSTRUCTIONS
 //		Checkout this folder via GIT or download the zip per 'PROJECT SETUP DETAILS' above.
 
 //	WARNINGS
 //		This is PBE VERSION 2, not VERSION 1. At the time of this project, PBE2 is not complete. It lacks features, contains bugs, and is subject to change.
 //
 //		The style of coding is solid, but in many places it is not the optimized solution. Its an easy-to-read solution.
 //
 //		The hitDetection is not perfect.
 //
 //		The 'size' of SpatialComponent may not be set correctly. So hitDetection and sensing when an object is 'offscreen' is 1/2 width off.
 //
 //		The game cannot 'resetGame()' yet. It has not been coded, but it is possible. You must close and open the flash game to 'restart'.
